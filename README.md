Rupio – Personalized Financial Router (AI Wallet Layer)
Project Overview
Rupio is an AI-powered financial router designed to simplify the way people make payments. Today, users juggle multiple payment methods — UPI, credit/debit cards, wallets, BNPL services, cashback apps, and EMI schemes. Choosing the right option for every transaction is complex, and users often miss out on rewards, incur unnecessary fees, or negatively affect their credit scores.
Rupio aims to solve this problem by automatically selecting the most financially beneficial payment method in real-time for every transaction. It acts as a financial brain on top of all your payment methods, helping users save money and make smarter financial decisions effortlessly.
